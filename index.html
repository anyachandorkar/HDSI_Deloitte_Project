                I'm a second year data science major. I love data science and video games,
                so I hope to one day start my own company working in Esports.

                through data science and am open to dipping my toes in various modes from consulting

                We were given seven different datasets each containing at least the following two columns:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>post_date: A date between March 1st, 2020 and September 20th, 2021 when the job was posted.</li>
                <li>count_id_indexed: The unique job listings for the dataset for a seven day period divided by
                    the unique number of job listings for the dataset from February 24, 2020 to March 1, 2020.</li>
            </ul>

        <h5 class="mt-2">What is our goal?</h5>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Out of the seven datasets, one was an overall look into job postings, and the rest were split into four
            categories which we formed our questions around. These four categories and questions can be viewed below.

            <b>Roles & Job Families: </b>
            <ul>
                <li>How did each job family perform over the course of the dataset?</li>
                <li>What roles performed the best and worst?</li>
                <li>How did senior job roles fare as compared to entry-level positons?</li>
                <li>What are potential reason for the trends?</li>
