                I'm about to finish my second year as a data science major. I love data science and video games,
                so I hope to one day start my own company working in Esports.

                I'm a second year data science major with a minor in Business Economics. I'm hoping to work in
                consulting as a Data Analyst or Business Intelligence Analyst. When I am not studying, I am working
                on my startup, listening to podcasts, or playing tennis.

        <h5 class="mt-2">What data were we given?</h5>
        <hr />
        <div class="col-6">
            <p>
                We were given seven different datasets each containing at least the following two columns:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>post_date: A date between March 1st, 2020 and September 20th, 2021 when the job was posted.</li>
                <li>count_id_indexed: The unique job listings for the dataset for a seven day period divided by
                    the unique number of job listings for the dataset from February 24, 2020 to March 1, 2020.</li>
            </ul>

        <h5 class="mt-2">How do we define job performance?</h5>
        <hr />
        <div class="col-12">
            <p>
                We define a count-id-index value of 1 to mean that the job industry, family, or role performed the same
                relative to right before COVID-19 began. In two of our analysis, we standardized the proportions within
                their groups in order to better understand the differences relative to their overall distribution.

        <h5 class="mt-2">What is our goal?</h5>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Out of the seven datasets, one was an overall look into job postings, and the rest were split into four
            categories which we formed our questions around. These four categories and questions can be viewed below.
