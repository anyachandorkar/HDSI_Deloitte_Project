            In general you can see that all 4 regions had similar trends in job performance across the months from
            March 2020-September 2021 and no one region was going significantly better than the other. There is a
            overall increasing, positive trend
            across regions with the exception of a dip in December 2020 and some variation in August 2021.

            <h5>The Dip in December 2020</h5>
            From the line graph you can see that all regions simultaneously had a dip around December 2020. The economy
            added 199,000 jobs in December which was less than half of what economists expected and the smallest number
            in that year.
            This was due to new cases of COVID-19 which skyrocketed to record highs, making December the deadliest, most
            infectious month
            of 2020. Due to this reason, the # of jobs available would decrease as there would be businesses closing
            again especially
            in hospitality and retail industries.

            <br>
            <br>

            <h5>Fluctuation in August 2021</h5>
            Despite the overall positive trend, we see a steep increase in jobs available around June 2021 and then
            around August 2021, the regions
            diverge in different directions, with the Midwest continuing to steeply increase, West and South stablizing,
            and Northeast steeply
            decreasing. After reopening many businesses in the summer of 2021, the South and Midwest regions borne the
            brunt of the
            summer wave of coronavirus infections. In these regions vaccination rates were low and states like Texas and
            Florida banned mask mandates.
            As a result, the number of Americans voluntarily quitting their jobs surged to a record high in August with
            more than 10 million vacancies
            especially in those regions. Following the same logic, many Northeastern states continued having their
            pandemic policies in place and thus
            didn't see many openings in jobs compared to other regions.

        <p class="col-12 mb-2">
            Our next step after assessing trends over time, was to create a model that could predict job performance for
            the remaining 3 months of 2021.
            We tested 4 different models: SES, Holt Linear, ARIMA, and Prophet to see which one would result in the best
            train/test error proportion.

                <br>
                <p>The Simple Exponential Smoothing Model isused for forecasting data with no clear trend or seasonality which is why 
                you see a straight plateaued line with no direction. Our data does have a positive trend so this model would not have a good test MSE.

                <br>
                <p>The Holt Linear Model is made for data with a trend but uses last estimated level plus some step size * last estimated trend value 
                which is why the forecast is going to continue going downwards since the previous data was negatively sloping. The forecast however
              should be showing a positive trend since the # jobs as the pandemic ends should generally increase. Therefore the test MSE would be high.

                   <br>
                   <p> The ARIMA model uses autocorrelations in the data rather than trends/seasonality of data. This model requires a 
                stationarity assumption (constant variance) which in this case, the data does not have constant variance as it 
                       fluctuates in an increasing pattern. Therefore the train MSE is higher. </p>

            <p> <b>Facebook's Prophet Model </b></p>
            <br>
            <p> Facebook's prophet model is a univariate additive time series model that takes into account trends and seasonality. 
                Since there is no seasonality but a positive trend, we see a positive linear forecast. This model results is a good train MSE
                and would also produce a better test MSE compared to the other models because it accounts for the lack of seasonality in the 
                data and a positive trend over time. In order to produce a better forecast and be able to account for the gaussian noise we 
                see in the data, we would need a lot more than 1.5 years worth of data.
