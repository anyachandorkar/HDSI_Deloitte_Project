            In general you can see that all 4 regions had similar trends in job performance across the months from
            March 2020-September 2021 and no one region was going significantly better than the other. There is a
            overall increasing, positive trend
            across regions with the exception of a dip in December 2020 and some variation in August 2021.

            <h5>The Dip in December 2020</h5>
            From the line graph you can see that all regions simultaneously had a dip around December 2020. The economy
            added 199,000 jobs in December which was less than half of what economists expected and the smallest number
            in that year.
            This was due to new cases of COVID-19 which skyrocketed to record highs, making December the deadliest, most
            infectious month
            of 2020. Due to this reason, the # of jobs available would decrease as there would be businesses closing
            again especially
            in hospitality and retail industries.

            <br>
            <br>

            <h5>Fluctuation in August 2021</h5>
            Despite the overall positive trend, we see a steep increase in jobs available around June 2021 and then
            around August 2021, the regions
            diverge in different directions, with the Midwest continuing to steeply increase, West and South stablizing,
            and Northeast steeply
            decreasing. After reopening many businesses in the summer of 2021, the South and Midwest regions borne the
            brunt of the
            summer wave of coronavirus infections. In these regions vaccination rates were low and states like Texas and
            Florida banned mask mandates.
            As a result, the number of Americans voluntarily quitting their jobs surged to a record high in August with
            more than 10 million vacancies
            especially in those regions. Following the same logic, many Northeastern states continued having their
            pandemic policies in place and thus
            didn't see many openings in jobs compared to other regions.

        <p class="col-12 mb-2">
            Our next step after assessing trends over time, was to create a model that could predict job performance for
            the remaining 3 months of 2021.
            We tested 4 different models: SES, Holt Linear, ARIMA, and Prophet to see which one would result in the best
            train/test error proportion.
