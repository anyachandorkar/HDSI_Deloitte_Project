            Almost all job families had a negative overall job posting proportion over the period the data was
            collected.
            Manufacturing/Operations Staff had an average performance of almost 0 while Facilities/Construruction had a
            slight increase of 0.1. It makes sense that most job postings performed worse relative to what they were
            right
            before COVID because of the lockdown and stay at home orders.
