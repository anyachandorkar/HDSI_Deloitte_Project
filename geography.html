            The darker the state, the better it is doing in terms of job performance compared to other states. The
            standarized proportions
            will be given a different range dependent on the data for the month. Therefore it is important to look at
            the value in comparison
            to the range and darkness. Midwest was consistently doing better than the rest of the US until month 9, when
            states evened out.

            In general you can see that all states had significantly larger job availability in 2021 than 2020. Almost
            every state has 1.5x more job
            availability in 2021 than 2020.

            The Hospitality and Entertainment industries were some of the most negatively affected industries from COVID
            in 2020 and 2021. It can be seen
            that the entirety of the US was affected negatively in the Entertainment industry. For the hospitality
            industry, California, North-West states,
            and North-East states were performing better than the rest of the country.
