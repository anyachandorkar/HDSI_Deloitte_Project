        <p class="col-6">
            In this portion of the analysis, we looked into how different roles and their respective job families faired
            during the
            pandemic. On the right, is a small graphic showing basic statistics on the dataset. The main question that
            we aimed to answer
            was:
            <br>
            <br>
            <I>What roles and job families had the highest and lowest proportions of postings throughout the
                pandemic?<br>
                What interesting
                insights
                can be made about these roles and of job families?

            Almost all job families had a negative overall job posting proportion over the period the data was
            collected.
            Manufacturing/Operations Staff had an average performance of almost 0 while Facilities/Construruction had a
            slight increase of 0.1. It makes sense that most job postings performed worse relative to what they were
            right
            before COVID because of the lockdown and stay at home orders.

            <h5>Why Real Estate Manager roles increased</h5>
            Since people who own property can't necessarily travel to their properties, they would hire
            someone who is near or onsite that could manage it for them.

            <h5>Why Bakery Supervisor roles increased</h5>
            This one isn't obvious why it would increase. This culd be due to COVID making people stay at home and more
            people explore their baking passion.
            So, when things began to open again, people started their own baking business and required a bakery
            supervisor.

            <h5 class="mt-3">Why Busperson roles increased</h5>
            In 2021 there was a huge bus driver shortage. This <a
                href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/school-districts-nationwide-facing-bus-driver-shortages/story?id=79124876">shortage</a>
            was already present, but it was made even worse by COVID.

            <h5 class="mt-3">Why Bricklayer roles increased</h5>
            Residential construction increased 14.9% which could be the cause of the Bricklayer role increase.
            Otherwise, I'm not exactly sure why.

            <h5 class="mt-3">Why Advertising Manager roles increased</h5>
            During 2021, there was an overall increase of 9.1% in marketing specifically. Over 17% of those were going
            to Senior Managers.

            <h5>Why Tax Professionals Decreased so much:</h5>
            I believe there are two reasons that Tax Professionals decreased so much compared to before covid.
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>The <a
                        href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/general/the-2020-tax-deadline-extension-everything-you-need-to-know/L8Ph4Vnci">tax
                        deadline</a> was extended to May 17th in 2021 due to COVID.</li>
                <li>Around <a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/taxes/filing/tax-professionals-for-taxes/">80%</a> of
                    Americans file their taxes using either TurboTax or without any assistance at all.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Why Kitchen Manager jobs decreased</h5>
            Since many restaurants were closed during covid or only doing delivery/takeout, there wasn't as much of a
            need for kitchen Managers because there wasn't as much of a time crunch for getting food out all together/on
            time.

            <h5 class="mt-3">Why Sales roles decreased</h5>
            Similarly to above, many stores closed for quite awhile and therefore didn't need sales people. Even when
            they did reopen, there were limited people allowed in stores, so they didn't require as many sales people.

            <h5 class="mt-3">Why Auto Mechanic roles decreased</h5>
            Since many places were closed and many people stayed at home, they didn't drive their vehicles and therefore
            didn't need to get maintenance done.

            <h5 class="mt-3">Why Team Member roles decreased</h5>
            This one is more difficult to figure out because the roles aren't specific to an industry. It's hard to
            pinpoint what being a Team Member even means. Even so, we can assume that during COVID anyone who might call
            themselves a team member (Grocery, clothing, department, etc. store workers) weren't working and therefore
            there were less postings for them.
